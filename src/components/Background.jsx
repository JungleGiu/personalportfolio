        My path to development is a bit unconventional – but maybe that's what
        makes it interesting -- I started my career in filmmaking.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-2">
        For years, I worked as a camera technician and data wrangler. My days
        were spent rigging camera systems, managing RAW footage workflows, and
        troubleshooting technical issues on set. Working with expensive
        equipment and tight schedules taught me to solve problems quickly and
        think systematically about complex technical setups.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-2">
        What I loved most was the <strong>teamwork</strong>. Film crews are all
        about collaboration – camera, sound, lighting, and post-production teams
        working in sync. Everyone depends on each other, and clear communication
        is essential. Coordinating between technical and creative teams taught
        me how to explain complex concepts in simple terms.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-2">
        During quiet moments between takes, I started experimenting with code to
        automate some of my data management tasks. That curiosity grew into
        genuine passion. I realized I was already thinking like a developer –
        debugging systems, optimizing workflows, ensuring data integrity.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-2">
        The transition felt natural. Both industries require adaptability,
        problem-solving under pressure, and constant learning. Now I'm fully
        committed – completed a full-stack JavaScript bootcamp with React focus,
        finishing my Angular specialization, and learning Python in my free time
        because I genuinely enjoy it.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-2">
        My film background brings technical precision, attention to detail, and
        strong collaborative skills to development. Ready to bring that same
        focus and teamwork to building great software!
